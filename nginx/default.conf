server {
    # The listen 80; line instructs Nginx to listen for incoming requests on port 80. This is the standard port for HTTP traffic, meaning any requests sent to your web server on port 80 will be handled by this configuration file.
    listen 80;

    # The index index.php index.html; line defines the default index files that Nginx should look for when serving requests. If a request is made for a file that doesn't exist, Nginx will first check for index.php, then index.html, in that order.
    index index.php index.html;

    # The server_name _; line specifies the server name for this configuration. In this case, the _ wildcard character matches any hostname, meaning this configuration will apply to all requests regardless of the hostname.
    server_name _;

    # The root /var/www/html/public; line defines the root directory from which Nginx should serve files. This means that when a request is made for a file, Nginx will look for it starting from the /var/www/html/public directory.
    root /var/www/html/public;

    # The location / { ... } block defines how Nginx should handle requests. The try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string; directive instructs Nginx to try to find the requested file ($uri) first. If not found, it will look for a file with the / appended ($uri/). If that still fails, it will look for index.php, adding the query string ($query_string) if present. This effectively handles both static files and dynamic requests.
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
